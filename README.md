# Want You Gone Portal Recreation

This project aims to recreate the iconic "Want You Gone" scene from the video game Portal using Lua, Python, and C#. The goal is to create an interactive experience reminiscent of the game's ending sequence, allowing users to engage with various elements from the game.

I reccomend you use windows terminal with the aperture color pallete for a more authentic experience. Here is the repo from where I have gotten the palette. [This one](https://github.com/EktoHunter/ApertureTerminal?tab=readme-ov-file)
